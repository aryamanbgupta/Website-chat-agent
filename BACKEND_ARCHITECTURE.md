# PartSelect Chat Agent — Backend Architecture

## Context

We're building the FastAPI backend for a PartSelect.com AI chat agent (InstaLILY case study). The backend orchestrates a Gemini 2.5 Flash agent that uses tool-calling to answer questions about refrigerator and dishwasher parts. We have 4,170 parts (101 enhanced with full data, 4,069 baseline), 10 enhanced repair guides, 51 blog articles (86K words), 1,500 model mappings, and 48 symptom mappings ready to go.

---

## 1. Agent Loop: Custom While-Loop (No Framework)

A simple `while True` loop — LLM decides which tool to call, we execute it, feed the result back, repeat until the LLM produces a text response.

```python
async def agent_loop(messages, tools):
    while iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS (5):
        response = await gemini.generate(messages, tools)
        if response.has_tool_calls:
            for call in response.tool_calls:
                result = execute_tool(call)
                messages.append(tool_result(call, result))
                yield status_event(f"Running {call.name}...")
        else:
            async for chunk in response.stream:
                yield text_delta(chunk)
            break
```

**Why not LangChain/LlamaIndex?** Our use case is 5 tools + 1 LLM — not complex enough to justify the abstraction tax. A custom loop is ~50 lines, fully debuggable, and signals stronger engineering to evaluators. Framework internals are hard to explain in the 1-hour Q&A.

**Why not a state machine?** The LLM is better at routing than hand-coded heuristics. A state machine breaks on multi-intent queries ("is PS11752778 compatible with my model and how do I install it?") while the agent loop handles them naturally by chaining tool calls.

---

## 2. The Five Tools

### Reasoning Parameter (all tools)

Every tool includes a **`reasoning: str`** required parameter. The LLM must explain:
- Why it chose this tool over the others
- Why it's passing these specific inputs

This parameter is **not used by tool logic** — it's for chain-of-thought (improves tool selection accuracy) and logging/debugging. The Gemini function declaration describes it as: `"Your reasoning for calling this tool with these parameters. Explain why this tool is the right choice and how you determined the input values."`

### `search_parts(reasoning, query, appliance_type?, max_results?)`
- **Regex first**: detect PS numbers (`PS\d+`) or model numbers → direct JSON lookup
- **Semantic search**: embed query → ChromaDB `parts` collection with `appliance_type` metadata filter
- **Knowledge augmentation**: also query `knowledge` collection for relevant blog/guide content when the query is symptom-like or mentions error codes/brands. Return knowledge snippets alongside parts.
- **3-tier fallback**: scoped (fridge/dishwasher) → all products → not found with suggestions
- **Mixed queries** ("Whirlpool ice maker"): run both keyword + vector, merge with reciprocal rank fusion
- Returns: list of parts (ps_number, name, brand, price, rating, image_url) + knowledge_snippets[] + tier + scope_note

### `check_compatibility(reasoning, part_number, model_number)`
- Normalize inputs → look up part in `parts_by_ps.json` → check `compatible_models` list
- Also reverse-check `models_index.json`
- Return `confidence: "verified"` when found, `"not_in_data"` when not (never say "incompatible" — we only have ~30 models per part due to scraping limits)
- When not in data: honest caveat + link to PartSelect.com for the full compatibility list
- Returns: compatible (bool/null), part info, confidence, message, source_url

### `get_installation_guide(reasoning, part_number?, symptom?, appliance_type?)`
- Part-based: look up difficulty, time, video from `parts_by_ps.json`
- Symptom-based: look up repair guide from `repairs.json` for step-by-step instructions
- Cross-reference: match part names against repair guide causes for richer results
- Returns: difficulty, time, video_url, steps[], tips, related_guide

### `diagnose_symptom(reasoning, symptom, appliance_type, model_number?)`
- Fuzzy-match symptom against 48 keys in `symptoms_index.json`
- Look up structured causes from enhanced repair guides in `repairs.json`
- **Also search `knowledge` collection** for relevant blog content (error codes, brand-specific troubleshooting). This is critical for queries like "Bosch E22 error" or "Samsung ice maker not working" that the repair guides don't cover.
- Link cause names to actual purchasable parts via name matching against parts DB
- If model_number provided, filter parts to compatible ones
- Returns: matched symptom, causes with recommended parts, knowledge_snippets[], follow_up_questions

### `get_product_details(reasoning, part_number)`
- Direct lookup in `parts_by_ps.json`
- Returns full product object + `data_tier` ("enhanced" vs "baseline") so LLM can caveat stale data
- Returns: all fields needed for frontend product card

## 3. Embedding & Search Strategy

### Three data sources to embed:

**Source 1: Parts (4,170)** — Entity-centric constructed documents (NOT raw_markdown)
For each part, build a search-optimized text document from structured fields:
```
Refrigerator Door Shelf Bin by Whirlpool. PS11752778 / WPW10321304.
$36.18, 4.9 stars (351 reviews). In stock.
This refrigerator door bin is a genuine OEM replacement...
Fixes symptoms: Door won't close, Ice or frost buildup, Leaking.
```
- **101 enhanced**: full doc with description, symptoms, all metadata
- **4,069 baseline**: shorter doc from name + brand + symptoms (if available) + price
- **Why not raw_markdown?** Navigation noise, image URLs, diagram references dilute embedding quality. Entity-centric docs are ~300-500 tokens — no chunking needed. One part = one vector.

**Source 2: Repair Guides (10 enhanced)** — Split by cause
- Each guide → 1 overview doc + 1 doc per structured cause (with description + steps)
- ~51 vectors total (10 overviews + 41 causes)
- Metadata: `appliance_type`, `symptom`, `cause_name`, `chunk_type=repair_guide`

**Source 3: Blog Articles (51)** — Split by H2 section
- These are the highest-value RAG addition: 86K words covering error codes, brand-specific how-tos, maintenance, and deep troubleshooting
- **Chunking**: split each blog by H2 headings. Each chunk = one self-contained topic/fix (~200-800 words)
- Estimated ~150-200 chunks from 51 articles
- Metadata: `appliance_type`, `content_type` (error_code/how_to/troubleshooting/etc.), `brands_mentioned[]`, `chunk_type=blog`
- **Critical for**: "Bosch E22 error", "how to reset Whirlpool dishwasher", "Samsung ice maker not working" — queries our parts/repair data can't answer

### Embedding model: Gemini Embedding 2

- Best text retrieval scores (MTEB #1) + `task_type` parameter (RETRIEVAL_QUERY vs RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT) = free accuracy boost
- Gemma 2 requires self-hosting on a GPU (Railway doesn't have GPUs) — not worth deployment complexity
- `text-embedding-004` is cheaper but at our scale the total cost difference is < $1
- If we add image upload later, Gemini Embedding 2 handles it with zero migration

### ChromaDB setup:
- **Two collections**: `parts` (4,170 vectors) and `knowledge` (~250 vectors from guides + blogs)
- Separate collections because search behavior differs: part search returns purchasable items, knowledge search returns informational content. The agent may query both or just one depending on the query type.
- 768 dimensions (Gemini Embedding 2 with Matryoshka truncation)
- Parts metadata: `ps_number`, `appliance_type`, `brand`, `data_tier`, `has_description`
- Knowledge metadata: `source_type` (repair_guide/blog), `appliance_type`, `content_type`, `brands_mentioned`, `symptom`
- Total: ~4,420 vectors

### Keyword fallback:
- Simple in-memory inverted index of part name words → PS numbers
- Catches cases where semantic search misses exact terms

---

## 4. Guardrails: Rule-Based Classifier (No Extra LLM Call)

A keyword/regex classifier runs BEFORE the LLM — zero latency, zero cost:
- **ON_TOPIC**: appliance keywords detected (fridge, dishwasher, etc.) or part number patterns → normal agent flow
- **GREETING**: hi/hello/thanks → pass to LLM, system prompt handles it
- **OTHER_APPLIANCE**: washer/dryer/range keywords → agent flow but search starts at tier-2
- **OFF_TOPIC**: no appliance signals → canned redirect, skip LLM entirely

System prompt is the primary guardrail. Each tool function also validates inputs (e.g., `diagnose_symptom` rejects `appliance_type="washer"` with a helpful message).

---

## 5. System Prompt: Few-Shot Tool Examples

The system prompt includes 3-4 worked examples showing correct tool selection with reasoning. These dramatically improve tool-calling accuracy.

```
## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Part number lookup
User: "Find part PS11752778"
→ Call search_parts(
    reasoning="The user provided a specific PS number. I should use search_parts with the exact
    part number rather than diagnose_symptom or check_compatibility, since they want to find/view
    a part, not check compatibility or diagnose an issue.",
    query="PS11752778"
  )
→ Then call get_product_details(
    reasoning="search_parts returned PS11752778. The user wants to see this part, so I should
    fetch full details to display a product card with price, rating, and image.",
    part_number="PS11752778"
  )

### Example 2: Compatibility check
User: "Is this part compatible with my WDT780SAEM1?"
(conversation context: previously discussed PS10065979)
→ Call check_compatibility(
    reasoning="The user is asking about compatibility between a previously discussed part
    (PS10065979) and their model WDT780SAEM1. This is a direct compatibility question,
    not a search or diagnosis.",
    part_number="PS10065979",
    model_number="WDT780SAEM1"
  )

### Example 3: Symptom diagnosis
User: "The ice maker on my Whirlpool fridge is not working"
→ Call diagnose_symptom(
    reasoning="The user describes a symptom (ice maker not working) on a specific appliance
    (refrigerator). This is a troubleshooting request, not a part search. I should diagnose
    first to identify causes before recommending specific parts.",
    symptom="ice maker not working",
    appliance_type="refrigerator"
  )

### Example 4: Multi-step (diagnosis + compatibility)
User: "My dishwasher won't drain. I have model WDT780SAEM1."
→ First call diagnose_symptom(reasoning="...", symptom="won't drain", appliance_type="dishwasher")
→ Read causes and recommended parts
→ Then call check_compatibility(reasoning="...", part_number="PS11753379", model_number="WDT780SAEM1")
→ Synthesize: diagnosis + compatible parts for their specific model
```

## 6. Streaming: SSE (not WebSockets)

**Why SSE over WebSockets?**
- **Vercel doesn't support WebSockets** on free/pro tier — this alone is decisive
- SSE works through CDN/proxies (Vercel edge, Cloudflare) natively
- Built-in auto-reconnect via EventSource API
- Our flow is unidirectional (user POSTs, server streams back) — WS bidirectionality is unused overhead
- Simpler: no connection management, heartbeats, or upgrade handshakes

```
POST /api/chat { messages, session_id }
→ text/event-stream

Event types:
  status              → "Searching for parts..." (while tool runs)
  product_card        → full part data for rich card rendering
  compatibility_result → yes/no badge
  diagnosis           → causes + recommended parts
  text_delta          → streamed LLM text tokens
  suggestions         → quick-reply options after answer
  error               → recoverable error message
  done                → stream complete
```

Product cards and structured results sent BEFORE the text explanation — user sees results immediately while LLM generates narrative.

---

## 7. Frontend ↔ Backend Connection (Vercel + Railway)

```
Vercel (Next.js)                    Railway (FastAPI)
  Browser → /api/chat  ──proxy──→  POST /api/chat (SSE)
            (Next.js API route)     (FastAPI endpoint)
```

**Next.js API route as proxy** (not direct CORS):
- Frontend calls `/api/chat` on its own Vercel domain
- A Next.js API route forwards the request to the Railway backend URL and pipes the SSE stream back
- Backend URL stays hidden (no CORS exposure), clean same-origin setup
- Can add auth/rate-limiting at the proxy layer later
- The proxy is ~15 lines of code

This means the FastAPI backend only needs to handle requests from the Next.js proxy, not from browsers directly. CORS is still configured as a safety net but the proxy handles the primary flow.

---

## 8. Session Management

- Server-side in-memory dict: `session_id → list[Message]`
- Frontend sends `session_id` (UUID) + latest user message per request
- Backend manages full conversation history including tool calls/results
- Store compact tool results in history (not full raw data)
- No summarization needed — Gemini 2.5 Flash has 1M token context window

## 11. Implementation Order (Embeddings First)

Build the data foundation first so tools are built directly against ChromaDB from the start.

### Phase 1: Data Layer + Embeddings
1. `config.py` — API keys, paths, model names
2. `data/loader.py` — Load all JSONs into memory at startup (parts.json, parts_by_ps.json, repairs.json, blogs.json, models_index.json, symptoms_index.json)
3. `data/embeddings.py` — Gemini Embedding 2 wrapper (task_type support, 768 dims)
4. `data/chroma_store.py` — ChromaDB client, two collections (`parts` + `knowledge`), query interface
5. `scripts/embed_parts.py` — Embed all 4,170 parts (entity-centric docs) into `parts` collection
6. `scripts/embed_knowledge.py` — Embed 10 repair guides (split by cause) + 51 blogs (split by H2) into `knowledge` collection
7. `data/search.py` — Hybrid search: regex detection → JSON lookup / ChromaDB vector / keyword fallback + RRF merge. Queries can target `parts`, `knowledge`, or both.
8. **Verify**: run test queries against both collections — part searches, error code queries, symptom queries

### Phase 2: Tools
9. `tools/registry.py` — Tool name → function mapping + Gemini function declarations
10. `tools/product_details.py` — simplest tool, pure JSON lookup
11. `tools/check_compatibility.py` — JSON lookup + honest "not in data" caveat
12. `tools/search_parts.py` — hybrid search (built on top of ChromaDB from phase 1)
13. `tools/installation_guide.py` — part lookup + repair guide cross-reference
14. `tools/diagnose_symptom.py` — symptom matching + cause-to-part linking + knowledge search
15. **Verify**: call each tool directly with benchmark inputs

### Phase 3: Agent + API
16. `agent/system_prompt.py` — system prompt text + few-shot examples
17. `agent/classifier.py` — rule-based intent classifier
18. `agent/loop.py` — the while-loop agent with Gemini function calling
19. `api/models.py` — Pydantic request/response schemas
20. `api/chat.py` — POST /api/chat SSE endpoint
21. `session/memory.py` — in-memory session store
22. `main.py` — FastAPI app, CORS, lifespan
23. **Verify**: end-to-end with all benchmark queries

---

## 12. Verification

Test against these benchmark queries:

**Core tool tests:**
1. `"Find part PS11752778"` → search_parts exact lookup → product card
2. `"Is PS11752778 compatible with WRS321SDHZ08?"` → check_compatibility → verified yes
3. `"The ice maker on my Whirlpool fridge is not working"` → diagnose_symptom → 4 causes from repair guide
4. `"How do I install PS10065979?"` → get_installation_guide → difficulty + video
5. `"I need a door gasket for my dishwasher"` → search_parts semantic → 2-3 gaskets

**Blog/knowledge tests:**
6. `"Bosch dishwasher E22 error"` → search knowledge collection → blog content with filter/drain fixes
7. `"How to reset my Whirlpool dishwasher"` → search knowledge → blog with reset instructions
8. `"Samsung ice maker not working"` → diagnose_symptom + knowledge search → blog + repair guide

**Guardrail tests:**
9. `"Can you help me fix my washing machine?"` → classifier → redirect (other appliance)
10. `"What's the weather today?"` → classifier → off-topic redirect

**Multi-step test:**
11. `"My dishwasher won't drain, find me a part for model WDT780SAEM1"` → diagnose_symptom → search_parts → check_compatibility chain

Run each query and verify: correct tool called, correct data returned, reasoning parameter logged, streamed response includes product cards, text is accurate.
